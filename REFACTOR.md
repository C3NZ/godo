# Refactor plan
## April 15th, 2019


### What am I refactoring?
* The entire todo list functionality.
* Writing tests for the todo list to ensure that it works as intended.
* Some database operations to improve the todo list code

### How will I do it?
1. Write some tests to test out the current implementation of the todo list
2. If all tests pass, immediately move on to refactoring our code.
3. If it doesn't, understand what went wrong and then jump into refactoring.
4. After refactoring our todolist, start writing tests for our database operations.
5. If all tests pass, refactor our database. If not, understand what is going wrong and then refactor.
6. Make sure everything complies with the refactor rubric
